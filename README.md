# ðŸ§¬Rosalind Solutions

This repository provides clean, function-based Python solutions to Bioinformatics [Rosalind](https://rosalind.info) problems, grouped by topic for clarity and maintainability.

---

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to strengthen algorithmic problem-solving skills in the context of bioinformatics while building a well-structured portfolio of solutions using Python.

## Notes

- All functions follow standard Rosalind input/output expectations
- Problems are grouped logically for easier review and reuse
- This repo is code-only; detailed explanations are in the [Bioinformatics Odyssey](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/bioinformatics-odyssey) repo

---

## Tools Used

- Python 3.x
- Standard library only (unless problem requires otherwise)
- Local and online testing via [Rosalind.info](https://rosalind.info)
